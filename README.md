# Dotty

ðŸŒŽ Simple dotfile manager

## Description

## Status Codes

- [generalStatus]-[homeDirStatus]-[dotDirStatus]

- generalStatus (general status of dotfile pair (symlink, file/folder). meaning if it's resolvable, might cause troubles)

  - OK (symlink exists and has backing folder/file)
  - OK_S (same as OK), but symlink has a trailing slash (trailing slash will be removed on reconciliation)
  - Y (resolvable on reconciliation)
  - E (inherent conflict)
  - M (missing)

- homeDirStatus (existance of dot in homeDir)
  - SYM, FILE, DIR, NULL
- dotDirStatus
  - same as above

## TODO:

- ensure valid link at any point in time (creation, pre-existance) points to valid file or folder. if resolved-to-location non-existant, prompt and create
